guacamole
=========

A little game to practice my web development.

Based on [My rails app template (just added to Github)](https://github.com/asakin/prototype-skeleton), a simple template for rapid development of
Rails4, Ruby2, CoffeScript, SaaS, Backbone, Marionette prototypes.

The game is based on a basic rails scaffold, and is implemented as a JS application written using [Marionette.js](http://marionettejs.com/)

A running demo can be seen at: [http://guacamole-game.herokuapp.com](http://guacamole-game.herokuapp.com)


Running the game
----------------
Provided that you have a rails environment set up with Rails 4.0 and Ruby 2.0, just clone this repo and run:

`rails server`

The game will be accessible on `http://localhost:3000`
